<p><strong>Hi guys!</strong> I totally forgot I had this blog thing. I&#39;ve been busy because of school for the last month or so, so I haven&#39;t had the time to either update this blog or make anything interesting. However, as my summer holidays were close to ending, I decided to finally make a few projects.</p>
<h2>Project #1 - üò± Something something, horror.</h2>
<p>I was bored and watching Youtube, and I stumbled upon a video reviewing the movie &quot;The Ritual&quot; (you can view it @ Netflix), and I decided to just watch the movie instead of the review a few minutes into the video. I didn&#39;t regret the decision at all. Amazing movie (frfr ong). It wasn&#39;t the best, there were a few parts where the dialogue was meh, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>
<p>Anyways, I randomly got inspiration to work on a game because of this movie. I haven&#39;t made much progress on the game yet, but I feel like this was worth mentioning as this game is the first project I&#39;ve worked on since <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloggy-md">bloggy</a>. So far, I&#39;ve made:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>very</strong> simple movement system with stamina and what not</li>
<li>Audio stuff (footstep, heartbeat, etc.)</li>
<li>A fear system (basically, <em>higher fear = higher stamina</em>, but <em>lower running/walking speeds</em>. Also makes the <em>heartbeat louder</em>!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I won&#39;t say much because well... there isn&#39;t much to say. It&#39;s made with Unity3D, my beloved (not really). As much hate Unity gets, I have to admit that the engine itself is pretty solid. The company is not the greatest to say the least but the product itself is amazing in my opinion.</p>
<h2>Project #2 - üöÄ rnux</h2>
<p><strong>This is the cool one :)</strong><br>Once again, I was bored and watching Youtube and I saw a video in my recommended, which was a showcase of <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycasts&#39;</a> windows port. This <em>unfortunately</em> gave me inspiration to make something similar. So, I made <a href="https://github.com/TheUnium/rnux">rnux</a>. It&#39;s an app launcher. It looks good. That&#39;s kind of it. Other than that, it is pretty broken and janky.</p>
<p>The main reason why it is so broken and janky is mainly because <strong>rnux</strong> was made in <strong>only &lt;6 hours</strong> in a single day. It&#39;s made in <strong>C++</strong> (the üêê), it uses <strong>Qt6</strong>, and it&#39;s <strong>X11</strong> only. Mainly because I still have PTSD from Wayland from back when it was horrendous to use on plasma.</p>
<p>Right now, it&#39;s not very mature, because again, <strong>&lt;6 hours of development</strong>, <em>however</em> it does have a few nice features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can... launch apps. Truly revolutionary</li>
<li>It can calculate basic arithmetic operations</li>
<li>It can search online</li>
<li>For a few online services (GitHub (<code>gh</code>), NPM (<code>npm</code>), and Cargo (<code>cargo</code>)), it can even fetch the top 10 results and show it without you having to leave</li>
<li>It can run a few system commands (like <code>shutdown</code>, <code>lock</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Fuzzy searching</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anyways...</h2>
<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. I&#39;ve been busy with studying for the last month, our summer holidays started and I felt like it was a good time to prepare for our board exams, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve not been able to work on my existing projects or create anything cool recently. I will probably be pretty inactive for most of this year, but I&#39;ll try to work on a project every once in a while.</p>
